# Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA)

* Use in supervised classification problems like image recognition and predictive analysis in marketing

# How it's work

1. Calculate separability between classes which is the distance between the mean of different classes. This is called the between-class variance.
2. Then Calculate  distance between the mean and sample of each class. It is also called the within-class variance.
3. Construct the lower-dimensional space which maximizes the between-class variance and minimizes the within-class variance.for that P(lower-dimensional space projection.)
