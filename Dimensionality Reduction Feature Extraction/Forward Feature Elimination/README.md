# Forward Feature Elimination

> Well,Forward Feature Elimination is basically the opposite of Backward feature elimination.

How it's work?

1. Train n number of models using each feature individually and checking the performance.
2. Then check which variable give more accuracy and give Best perfomance.
3. Next, we will repeat this process and add one variable at a time.
4. We will repeat the entire process until there is no significant improvement in the modelâ€™s performance.
